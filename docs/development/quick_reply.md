# Quick Reply

Quick Replies are pre-built message templates (canned responses). Agents can insert or send them in one click to reply faster and keep messaging consistent.

Common use cases:

- Frequently asked questions (business hours, policies, address, etc.)
- Guided scripts (collecting info, next steps, instructions)
- Standard responses that should be consistent across agents

## Create a Quick Reply

Create a new Quick Reply in the admin console and fill in the title/content.
